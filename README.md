This is a GitHub repository for the first NU Coding Bootcamp project.

Purpose: This application is meant to provide users with recipe and wine suggestions based on the userâ€™s available kitchen ingredients. 

Getting Started: Download from Github and click on the index file to open the site.

Prerequisites: You will need a Chrome browser.

Installing: No installation is required. Simply access the index file.

Deployed Site: https://jem3523.github.io/BCEJ-Project01/

Usage: The user will be able to enter the names of various ingredients and add them to a box before submitting them. Upon submitting these ingredients, a recipe-providing API will take these ingredients in as parameters, which will initiate a search for recipes containing those ingredients. 

In addition, the resulting recipe serves as a second parameter for the API, and pulls a wine pairing for the recipe. Both the recipe and wine pairing are displayed, and the user can view the recipe by clicking on a link. 

Testing: Responsive design testing for laptop, desktop, and mobile to ensure user experience adapts easily across screen sizes. API Request and response testing was done manually by entering variations of ingredients to test the limitations of the available API functions.              

Built With: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Pure Wireframe, Spoonacular API, ShutterStock Images
